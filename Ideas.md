Fancy WebGL rendering I guess?

I could also just use rough.js??

If I can do some spectral lighting like https://www.instagram.com/p/CWN3j2lMi9z/, that would make it so fancy.


## What textures?

soo
question

what would it take ...
... to get it so I could make jerd
export a js + shader whatsit
that could consume State & draw these dealios?

I'd need to be able to SDF it up
which, that's super easy.
and then what about "consuming an array of polygons,
the number might change from scene to scene"?

I'd like to be able to have the "count of polygons" be like
set as a toplevel #define, and so my js code could just find & replace
that before compiling. That sounds cool.

Alternatively, would it be better/faster/idk to /inline/ all of the items?
if we're generating the shader on the fly anyway....
just have one supermassive "hard-coded" sdf?
now, if I didn't hard-code it, then I could
concievably do live update.
But that sounds fraught.


Very nice thesis: https://core.ac.uk/reader/4274127 extending the much earlier watercolor paper.

Can I ... render watercolors for each cell?
might be a little extra
but like, should be doable? idk.

https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WtjGRc - maybe do a papercraft look?
- different shapes at different levels?

this has a nice, very subtle noise to it

ooh this has a veryy pleasing paper background:

ok but this is just really interesting looking https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MlKSDm


yeah I love the grain they achieve on this one:

oh hey it's an actual implementation of the paper
