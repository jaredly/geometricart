UP NEXT:

- [x] PATHSSSS
- [x] how to add? ~simpler one is: point, segment, point.
	- have a `pendingPath`
	- need to be able to find segments adjacent to a point
		should be quite doable.
- [x] HOVERRRR to add. and then 'enter' to commit.
- [x] Some intersections (where there are multiple intersections) aren't working.
- [x] Mirrors for paths my folks! Need to update the Undo to remove a bunch of ids. But should be fine.
- [x] Style! Got to have style!
- [x] profit? like this is so gooood.
- [x] hide guides
- [x] almost-tangent circles should report connection.
- [x] color things my folks.

- [x] hover so good
- [ ] let's go ahead and show the Mirrors! So we know where they are pointed and such.
- [ ] ok I actually have to deal with the sweep flag folks.
- [x] CIRCLE IS TANGENT, need to fix.
- [ ] click  guide to hide it. undo brings it back of course.
- [ ] add option to NOT extend a line. can keep things a lot cleaner.
	- maybe like 'capital L' is for line that doesn't extend? idk
- [x] flip? does it work?

# WHAT does hover-to-add look like?
- first off, not through actions. don't need to save that nonsense.
- at p = 0
	- show offshoots of p0
- at p > 0
	- show offshoots of the prev, and offshoots of the current.
- hovering an already-chosen line rolls back to that one.



- [ ] track down those bugs
	- [ ] I was getting something from the wrong circle
	- [ ] an intersection didn't have all offshoots

FUTURE TOOLS:

- [x] click 3 points, get the incircle
- [ ] 3 points, get the circumcircle

---

- [x] Looks like lineCircle intersection is wonky -- see example.
- [x] vertical lines are wrongg
- [x] make a way to export
	- The SVG, with the json embedded you fools.
	- Have the guides and junk be part of one layer, so it's easy to remove.
- [x] lets bake in really good undo/redo. should we do the whole tree?
	- but it doesn't get downloaded, right? or does it? could get a little big.
- [x] OH! undo across branches is broked.



sooo
for "mirrored paths"
...
...
i think my current concept of groups is probably weird.
anyway,
1st pass = just create separate things, you can shift+select I guess to format them at the same time.
- oooh ok so you can like double-click a path, and it will select the other paths that are its siblings.
- oh and I had a "select all things with this fill", which I could do again. so lets go on this path (heh) for a while.

2nd pass = maybe have just one instance, with nested configurations according to the mirrors at play? idk.


THEN

make sure multiple mirrors is working!

THEN


DONT FORGET:
- need to put points in the middle of circles, probably.
	- NOPE
