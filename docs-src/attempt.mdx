# Playing with Polygons! (and more)

So the shapes we're dealing with consist of straight lines and arcs.
We could generalize this to deal with bezier curves too I think? idk.
Yeah as long as you give me an offset algorithm, it's fine. Looks like it's pretty computationally expensive, so beware I guess.

Anyway, the things we'll be talking about:

-   clipping one shape by another shape!

and

-   offsetting a shape! this will re-use some of the work from clipping a shape.

<LineLine />

Ok so how was that?

<ArcArc />

<div style={{ height: 200 }} />
