/**
 * So, insetting a path is pretty complicated!
 *
 * The main steps are:
 *
 * 0. ensure that the path is clockwise. we assume it's also non-intersecting at this point
 * 1. inset each segment by the given amount.
 * 	 1a. at concave corners, extend segments to their new meeting point
 *   1b. at convex corners, join segments with a two lines via the original corner
 * 2. You now likely have lots of self-intersections! Each convex corner now has a self-intersection,
 *    and depending on how exciting the shape was to start with you might have many more. Split all
 * 	  segments along any intersections, so you're left with only non-intersecting segments.
 * 3. Find your clockwise regions (counter-clockwise regions can be ignored)! Go through your little
 *    segments, and when you come to a cross-road, take the exiting segment that is most-clockwise. I think.
 * 	  TODO verify that.
 * 4. Some of your clockwise regions might be contained within one another! Others might actually be holes.
 *    Use a winding rule to discard regions with a negative winding number, and then discard regions that are
 *    contains within another region.
 *
 * Then you're done!
